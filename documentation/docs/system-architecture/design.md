Design
=============================

**Purpose**

The Design Document - Part I Architecture describes the software architecture and how the requirements are mapped into the design. This document will be a combination of diagrams and text that describes what the diagrams are showing.

### Components

**Client**

![Basic Wireframe](/img/wireframe.png)

##### Figure 1 - Mobile App Wireframe

Figure 1 shows a mockup wireframe of the TuTraffic mobile application.

- This is an android application that will require the use of 3 main pages with adjacent xml files and adapters for each view used. 
- The client will be connected to the server via built in functionality within android studio and google cloud. These classes are autogenerated by android studio and are shown as RegisterActivity and DeviceInfoEndpoint respectively.

### Algorithms

**Computer Vision**

The Raspberry Pi nodes utilized for this product are equipped with cameras that will take photos at fixed intervals in order to be sending up-to-date data to the server. To ensure real-time processing so users will not be presented with inaccurate information, the Raspberry Pi will take and process multiple images a minute. When a Raspberry Pi node takes a photo, the photo will be edited and processed through a computer vision algorithm hosted on the Raspberry Pi itself. Computer vision is a subfield of machine learning, meant to view images and replicate the human thought process to make a decision based on what it "sees".

Currently, the computer vision aspect of TuTraffic is being developed with the detection algorithm YOLO. YOLO is a relatively fast object detection algorithm as it utilizes a one-stage detector strategy - this means as opposed to other much slower algorithms, YOLO looks at an image only once and goes through its entire network one time to determine if objects it has been trained to detect are present. YOLO is run on OpenCV, an open source computer vision/machine learning software library. One of the classes in YOLO's detectable objects list are cars - car detection will be a necessary tool in detecting parking spots on streets.

TuTraffic detects both street parking and parking in traditional parking lots. YOLO's car detection is the biggest component of street parking, while OpenCV's built in line detection is the biggest component for parking spots in a parking lot. OpenCV has a fast line detection algorithm built into its library and does not require the use of any additional object detection algorithms. YOLO's car detection and OpenCV's line detection will work together to detect parking spots in both environments.  

![Computer vision diagram](/img/computer_vision_diagram.png)

##### Figure 3.1 - YOLO diagram

Figure 3.1 shows the process an image goes through and its output when ran through the YOLO object detection algorithm supported by OpenCV. The original image is first transformed into a blob format to be read by the network. YOLO then completes two steps - one surrounding the blob in boxes of different thickness to indicate confidence of an object being present, and the other adding a colored probability map over the image to indicate the objects the algorithm believes exists in those locations. The bounding boxes and probability map are combined to create the final image, boxes surrounding the detected objects with their label & probability.

##### Figure 4.1 - Client State Diagram

Figure 4.1 shows the state diagram of the frontend application, describing the different behaviors of the TuTraffic application.

The TuTraffic client application experiences multiple states throughout its usage. As depicted in the figure above, its first state is Searching: in this state, the client displays a list of nearby parking spaces, which may be initially empty. The client enters the Viewing state after the user selects a parking location; they can return to the Searching state to view the other locations, or enter the Navigation state. In either the Searching or Viewing State, the client submits requests to the server, such as parking status updates or reservations, in the Requesting state before returning to the previous state. In the Navigation state, the client connects to a third party navigation service and receives real-time driving assistance to help them reach their selected parking location. After the client reaches their destination or ceases navigation, the application returns to the Viewing state.

##### Figure 4.2 - Server State Diagram

Figure 4.2 shows the state diagram of the backend server, exhibiting the different modes the server may be acting in.

The figure above illustrates the server states of the TuTraffic system. The server starts in the Waiting state; it is idle while there are no jobs to complete. When it receives a request from a client or node, the server proceeds to the Handling state, in which it comprehends the request. Then, the server enters a Reading or Writing state to handle the reading or writing operations, respectively, that are necessary to fulfill the request. For example, a search query is primarily a reading operation, while a parking reservation request is primarily a writing operation. Finally, the server formulates a response, delivers the message in the Replying state, and returns to the Waiting state before the next job.

#### Figure 4.3 - Raspberry Pi Node State Diagram

Figure 4.3 shows the state diagram of the Raspberry Pi node as it cycles through different behaviors.

Each Raspberry Pi node in the TuTraffic system begins in the Waiting state, as shown in the above state diagram. The node exits this Waiting state on a regular schedule or upon request, then enters the Capturing state, during which it records an image. The node proceeds to the Processing state, in which computer vision is used to produce a parking location update message. This update is pushed to the server during the Sending state, then the node resumes the Waiting state.
