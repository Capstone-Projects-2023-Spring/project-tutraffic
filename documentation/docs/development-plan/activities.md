## Detailed Design

## Testing

We will utilize different types of testing to assess the functionality of our project in various aspects.

1. Unit Testing
    - Unit tests are useful in testing indivudual components of software, showing developers if methods/functions are working as intended and can be done throughout development starting early.
        - unittest, a Python unit testing framework, for the raspberry pi code
        - JUnit, a Java unit testing framework, for the Android mobile application 

2. Integration Testing
    - Integration testing focuses on verifying that multiple units of the overall product are working with eachother correctly. This will be essential in TuTraffic's development as we combine hardware and software.
        - "hello world" test in preliminary development to ensure all modules can communicate with one another in general
        - tests in later development to ensure data is flowing in correct form and order

3. Acceptance Testing
    - Acceptance tests are for simulating user stories in real-time to confirm the application can fulfill the basic needs of a user.
        - tests will be performed at the end of development with people not on the team to receive feedback regarding functionalty and usability
