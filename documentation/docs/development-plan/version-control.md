# Version Control
Github Repository
The Github Repository used for this projects version control can be accessed in three ways. First is directly through VScode's Git integration. Second is throught the terminal. Third is directly throught the gitub website. We will use these tools to be able to modify and update our project as we go along and always retain the ability to return to a previous project state.
