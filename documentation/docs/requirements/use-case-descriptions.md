# Use-case descriptions

## Use Case #1
**George is a commuter student and needs to find a spot on or around campus.**
1.	In the TuTraffic app, George enters the address of the area he is attempting to find parking at or around - his university.
2.	George sets his preferred range for parking to ½ a mile, so he does not have to walk too far to class. 
3.	The application displays to him the available parking spots in his desired range.
4.	George selects the parking spot that looks the best to him and clicks “start route.”
5.	 The application pulls up the Google maps API to direct George to his spot.


## Use Case #2
**Alicia is driving into the city for a doctor’s appointment and wants to avoid pricey parking spots.**
1.	Alicia first removes parking garages from her parking preferences as she knows garages in the city do not usually fit her budget – especially for her short trip.
2.	 She edits her price range in the TuTraffic trip settings to look for spots anywhere from 0 to 5 dollars.
3.	Alicia puts in her destination and TuTraffic displays the spots in that area that match her preferences.
4.	Alicia selects a spot, and the maps API directs her to it.

## Use Case #3
**The Smith family needs to find a way to park their large van when they go out on family outings.**
1.	Mr. Smith launches the TuTraffic application and goes to edit user settings.
2.	In user settings, he can edit the size of his vehicle to be “van / extra-large” - the app settings offering a range of sizes that best describe the user’s vehicle.
3.	From now on, TuTraffic will only show parking spots that could fit an extra-large vehicle such as a van to Mr. Smith.
